Within this repository, you'll find individual screenshots illustrating the project's results, along with a PDF compilation for convenient reference. The VB file included here contains the full script utilized throughout the project. Additionally, due to its size, the macro-enabled 'multiple_year_stock_data' workbook is accessible via a Gmail link provided for your convenience. This workbook, complementing the VB script, offers a comprehensive overview of the project's functionality. Furthermore, a smaller test workbook has been included, complete with the full script, for experimentation and testing purposes.
